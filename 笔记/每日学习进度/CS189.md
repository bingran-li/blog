- [ ] lecture 5 linear regression 2
## regularization
feature selection/add constraints
Issue: there are infinity numbers of $w_{MLE}$ solutions. (By directly computation, or use graph to illustrate). We need to pick one. Criteria: Choose the $\hat{w}$ with the smallest norm.
MLE yields a point estimate of our parameter through maximize $p(D|\theta)$. It may be not good.
### L2 regression (shirnkage)
